# Live Demo


# Built With

- JavaScript
- HTML5
- CSS3

# Requirements

- Keep your code clean.
- Do not commit console.log to your repo. - It‚Äôs ugly, it kills performance and it can make confidential data be visible in the browser tools.
- Keep the number of changes/updates to the DOM as low as possible, they are very expensive for the browser.
- Keep the application logic separated from DOM manipulation tasks.
- Keep all the styling logic in CSS files. If you use node modules
- lock files should be in the repository to avoid problems with future versions of the dependencies. If you use ES6
- use object destructuring to get the values from an object. This way you can avoid repeating a lot of code.

# Setup

- Clone the repository on your local machine
- Cd into the folder
- Open index.html file

# Install
- Install VSCode or any code editor you like
